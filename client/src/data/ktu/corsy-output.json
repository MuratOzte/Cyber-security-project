    "description": "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, and port) than its own origin.",
    "severity": "info",
    "recommendation": "It is recommended to set the CORS policy to only allow trusted origins. This can be done by setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the trusted origin. For example, if the web application is hosted at https://example.com, the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header should be set to https://example.com.",
